Algorithm Design:

Def getDist() // Returns the distance between two points

// Always called from perspective 
Def getMatches(radius, time, address, direction) // Returns matches
{
    
}

Def search(driveOrRide, time, location) // Returns all users that match criteria
{
    If is not Driving {
    Matches = []

        For all drivers {
            matches [i] = getMatches()
}

Intersection = []
intersection = intersectionOf(matches)
}
